  <h1>For example: Nike advertising</h1>
  <p>It all started with a Crazy Idea — the dream of a 24-year-old boy from Oregon to change his life and leave his mark on history.
    Phil Knight, a young Stanford graduate, borrowed a couple hundred dollars from his father, took a chance — and made a revolution in the world of sports shoes.</p>

  <h3>A brief history of the creators</h3>
  <p class="claasforp">Phil Knight enrolled at the University of Oregon to join the legendary coach's team. Bill Bowerman taught the young a thlete not to get hung up on the result and improve his team skills. After university, Phil entered Stanford,
    defended his term paper there on the topic "Prospects for the development of production in Japan." The student was inspired by the idea of cooperation with Japanese manufacturers. He realized that exporting inexpensive sneakers to the United
    States could be a good alternative to expensive shoes for professional athletes. At that time, ordinary cheap sneakers were uncomfortable and bulky, but they cost only $ 5 against $30 for expensive ones. Phil Knight decided to change the
    situation and compete with brands from Germany in the field of sports equipment.Bill Bowerman praised the spirit of competition and the ability to work in a team — principles that later formed the basis of the corporate culture of the Nike brand.
    He was an innovator and sought to improve everything around him, including sports shoes and equipment. For his students, he created lighter shoes to achieve records. He invented a special coating for treadmills that absorbed shocks and protected
    athletes from injury.</p>
